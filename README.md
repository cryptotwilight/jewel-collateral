This is the jewel collateral project repository.

The Jewel Collateral project has been created to determine how to introduce and leverage Non-Specific Collateral (NSC) in DeFi. Non-Specific Collateral allows for the introduction of assets such as Fractional Real Estate, Digital Twins from Supply chains, On chain product representations to be 
resolved into a form of collateral that can be tangibly liquidated should the need arise. The applications of Non-Specific Collateral are wide ranging as they introduce a new form of operational finance that can allow investors to forego stocks and shares and actually directly finance revenues.

To illustrate a company my produce X widgets, which can then be resolved into Non-Specific Collateral with a given real value. On chain investors can now ledge against this collateral. As the collateral is operational it is actively being sold with payment going directly back to servicing of the loan. 
The investors now no longer need to go through lengthy investement processes to lend to the company and for the company the borrowing process is much more efficient with much lower overheads.
